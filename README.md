# YT_playlist_backup
If you are tired of your videos disappearing from yt playlists then this python program is just for you! :)
By simply double-clicking you can create a file containing lists of titles for all your yt playlists so that if a video gets deleted one day you will be able to see what it was called and who uploaded it

Please be aware that:
  -by default the program can only create copies of playlists that are public, however you can manually add non-public playlists by appending strings with their ids to playlist_list. Private playlists cannot be accessed via this program
  -you will need to enter your api key in order for this to work [line 7]. If you don't have it you can follow the instructions to get one here: https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started
  -you will also need to enter your channel id [line 51].
  -you will also need python to run the code.
  
Thank you
